        <h2>The Path <br />To Becoming A CyberLord</h2>
        <p>
          I discovered programming with endless curiosity and a vision for the
          future. The journey began with countless tutorials, broken code, and
          persistent late-night debugging sessions. Consistency became my
          greatest strength—I showed up every day, learning bit by bit until the
          once-impossible started to feel natural.
          <br /><br />
          I was never too proud to ask questions, whether online or from
          seasoned developers, and I joined friendly competitions to push my
          limits. Each challenge sharpened my skills, and every setback fueled
          my growth. Guided by a clear vision, I set targets: building a
          portfolio, contributing to projects, and eventually mastering advanced
          skills.
          <br /><br />
          Though I’m still learning, I know the road to becoming a CyberLord is
          long. With a hunger to grow and an honest passion for progress, I
          continue coding, learning, and evolving, knowing every small step
          brings me closer to my dream.
